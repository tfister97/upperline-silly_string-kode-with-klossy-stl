# Silly String

A string in Ruby is an data type that holds words, numbers, and other characters. A string is just data. This lab is going to be a refresher on how to create and manipulate strings. You'll code your solution in `silly_string.rb`

You can read about strings and all the methods available [here](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/String.html).

NOTE: This lab does not have tests, so the `learn` command wont work. Instead, just write your code and test it out manually by running `ruby silly_string.rb` in the command line. If the output looks like it's intended to, you're good to go and can use `learn submit` to submit your work!


##Challenge:
1. Create a string that contains your favorite word. It can be in any language!

2. Using a method built into ruby, capitalize every letter in the string you just created

3. Now let's make all the characters lowercase in the string `"IM NOT SHOUTING"`

4. Using a method built into ruby, count how many letters are in the string `"supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"`

5. Now let's add more words to that string, using `+` just like in math. That's called concatenation. Let's add together to the two strings `"wow"` and `"mom"`.

6. Now let's capitalize just the first letter of the sentence `"i really like programming"`

7. Let's take the string `"Astounding aardvarks, arguably an ancient animal, always ate apples and acorns and artichokes all around Athens, amazing!"`. We want to use the `gsub` method to switch all `A` for `O`, as well as all `a` for `o`. We'll need to chain `gsub`s.
